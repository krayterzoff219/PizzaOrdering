# UpperCrust Pizza Ordering
Full-stack web application that allows users to place orders and create accounts on a Vue.js framework. Data from orders is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is communicated with via a Java back-end. Employees can then call that information to view pending orders, process those orders, and change the availability and options for menu items, toppings, crusts, etc.
